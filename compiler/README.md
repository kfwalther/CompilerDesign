This Compiler project/program utilizes ANTLR 4 C++ tools to compile a C- (C-Minus) 
program file. C-Minus is a subset of the C language.





Using CMake to generate the build environment for the project, we place all of the compiler
specific build environment files into the folder 'VS15W64'. It is named this way because Visual
Studio 15 (2017) was used to build the code. After running CMake, the generated Visual Studio solution
can be opened and the project can be compiled. 

Some ANTLR-generated C++ files are created based on the grammar inputs. These grammar inputs
are specified with the following two files, and the generated C++ code is placed into the
'compiler/compiler/generated' directory.

 - compiler/grammar/TLexer.g4
 - compiler/grammar/TParser.g4
 
One of the targets generated by CMake actually calls 
an ANTLR .jar file, which is used to auto-generate the C++ code from the 'g4' grammar definition files. 

The custom code written from scratch for this assignment makes use of the generated files, for
printing Token information and generating a Parse Tree after parsing the input. This custom
code is located in the 'compiler/compiler' directory, and the relevant classes files are:

 - AstNode
 - AstVisitor
 - AstVisitorImpl
 - Compiler
 - ErrorHandler
 - ParseTreeListenerImpl
 - ParseTreeVisitorImpl
 - SemanticAnalyzer
 - SymbolTable
 
Once the project is compiled, the executable will be placed in the 'VS15W64/compiler/Debug' folder. A
Windows batch script is provided in the top-level directory to call the executable and run 
the program with all test input files. This code was built and tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10.
The format for running the compiler program is the executable, followed by an input file name:

ANTLR4GrammarTest.exe C:\Users\user\CompilerDesign\compiler\tests\C-Input-1.txt

After running the program with each input file, the output is piped to a corresponding output
file located in the 'compiler/tests/output' directory. The output prints the following information:

 - Token list
 - Parenthesized parse tree (undecorated)
 - Indented AST (decorated)
 - Symbol Table (with token information)

Tokens have the following format when printed: [@<A>,B:C='D',<E>,F:G]
where A through G translate to:
A: Token Index
B: Symbol Start Position in Entire File
C: Symbol Stop Position in Entire File
D: Token String
E: Token Type Enumeration
F: Token Line Location in File
G: Token Character Position in Line

In addition, symbol table entries and AST nodes have further information populated, some of 
which includes:
 - CMinus Native Type: UNKNOWN, INT, VOID
 - Symbol Record Kind: UNKNOWN, VARIABLE, ARRAY, FUNCTION, NUMBER
 - Rule Type
 - L-value/R-value flags
 - Location stored in memory
 - Storage size in memory
 - Evaluated value
