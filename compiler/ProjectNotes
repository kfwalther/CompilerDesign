ANTLR Installation

 - Clone the ANTLR repo to computer.

 - Download the antlr-complete.jar from the main site and put it somewhere in repo

Use CMake to build demo
CMake for Eclipse/MinGW has link errors.
CMake for Visual Studio works well.

Using instructions from the site below to build entire project
with CMake from scratch:
http://blorente.me/Antlr-,-C++-and-CMake-Wait-what.html
This builds using the provided vcproj files (which are 32-bit). We want 64-bit so
going to use a different approach.

Copy the C++ runtime code from the repo (antlr4\runtime\Cpp) to a local directory. Then,
copy the antlr-complete.jar from the main site and put it into this directory also.
